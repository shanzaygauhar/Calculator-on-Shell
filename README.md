Calculator on Linux Shell

## Execution
Download/clone the repository and then open terminal and navigate to the cloned directory, and for this code to compile, only run 

`bash shell.sh`

on the terminal and then 
1. The program will ask the user to input the number.
2. After user has entered the number, the code will perform necessary checks and then prompt the user to enter the operation they wish to perform.
The user will enter:
* 'a' for Addition,
* 's' for subtraction,
* 'm'for multiplication and 
* 'd' for division.
3. Afterwards the user will be prompted to enter the second number and after successfully clearing all the checks, we will output the corresponding answer.

#### Note:
If the number contains any symbol, we inform the user that the input is invalid and terminate. In case number is less than 1 or greater than 100, we inform the user that
the number is out of range.
